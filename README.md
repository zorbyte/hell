## The term "Hell"

I know I have to do it, so why the heck not here. I do not intend to offend any parties by the usage of the term hell. In this particular context, it is used in a purely satirical manner and only refers to your tangible suffering, and should not be interpreted in any spiritual or other manners that were not intended by the author (me, zorbyte) of this webpage.

## Facetious Author

The Author of this software is extremely facetious about this particular piece of work (and is intentionally avoiding stating that he is facetious about all work, as he would ruin all future job prospects in the software development industry).
